# Regency Screens — Shopify Migration Case Study

## Project Overview
Regency Screens was originally built on a legacy CMS with a highly customized frontend and a complex backend workflow.  
Due to backend limitations and frequent downtime, the client decided to migrate the platform to Shopify.

The biggest challenge was preserving the existing design while moving to a more stable and scalable system.
